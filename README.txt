Description:

This folder was a project created for my Digital Literacies class in the fall of 2017. The goal of the project was to teach us the basics of coding for the web, specifically XML, XSL, HTML, and CSS. The resulting website was the deliverable.

My grade for this project was 203/200; I quickly grasped the basics of the code aspect and took advantage of extra credit by including my reflection memo on the website instead of as a separate document. The home page was another addition that I used to challenge myself to learn more about CSS beyond what was necessary for the project.
